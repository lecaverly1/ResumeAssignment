          <h2>Graphic Design Student and Intern</h2>

          <p> Hi there! I'm Lauren Caverly. Ever since I was young, I've had a passion for art and design. That excitement is now an everyday experience when working in graphic design. I love color, lines, illustrating, and learning new tricks when it comes to the ever-changing world of design. I hope this gives an insight into my life and my passion for design! </p>

            <h3>Girl with the Pearl Earring Illustration</h3>
            <p>This project was meant to take a well known picture and use only squares and rectangles to recreate. I did the first one on the very right with only ovals to push myself even further than the project required. I really enjoyed this project and the detail I got in my illustration.</p>
